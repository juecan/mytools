Hello
Put the Chan _ sebi.c in Asterisk 1.4 - ADDONS folder channels
The voice only tested with Huawei k3520 (e169 vodafonizado)
By the way this firmware 11.314.12.02.00 (with the voice that was not gonna....)
The web of vodafone.de is low
Http: / / www.vodafone.de / Technischer Hilfe - support / support / 97002 _ 131991.html
Compile and install as usual
You need to usbserial modem ports are visible. Fedora 10 detects the running kernel 2.6.27 on something
With older kernels for usbserial googling VMC Linux release ports

Eye - the user that gun asterisk must have read and write permissions in the TTY ports (googling is gerund)
 
CONFIGURACION
 
sebi.conf in etc/asterisk (Or where you have asterisk)
A look at the configuration file, and is more or less clear huawei1 is a k5320 with voice and SMS
It is only in huawei2 E270 with SMS
The name of the channel is free. Each section is a modem
Put the IMEI of the modems in the configuration file. If you carry the modems which can remove the pin cards or if you don't put the pin in the conf file
 
Volume For the voice ==> 1 min, 5 max
 
To see the State of modems Sebi show devices
 
*CLI> sebi show devices
ID              IMEI              Group           Provider        Connected State Voice SMS

You said the configured port Voice SMS capabilities and the State
If there is a channel in init is stuck by something
Send logs to go watching
 
To call for Dial("SIP/109-023a85b0", "sebi/huawei1/2688|300|" por ejemplo
 
To send SMS from Asterisk
 
SebiSendSMS  tech/channel|numero|"mensaje blabla"
Sebisendsms Tech / channel number | "message | blabla"
 
To test the rough e.g. originate SIP / 109 application sebisendsms Sebi / huawei1 | 609123456 | "works as the mqueue of sendmail?"
As reglita received in the dialplan
 
Executing [sms@from-pstn:1] NoOp("Sebi/huawei2-47a4", "Catch-All DID Match - Found sms - You probably want a DID for this.")
 
Based on the system of Chan _ mobile (that and more code chunks. :) There are manuals for Chan _ mobile so that they refer to send / receive SMS to them provisionally
The Alfa E220..... Without voice
Keep the commands of the modems in the log. The reception of an SMS.

Bad writing is clear IMEI
Also goes wrong adapter - > have some without pin first the three errors (three starters ed Asterisk block adapter and put the PUK)
Sim PUK or for those who ignore me
If your IMEI is not correct is not trying to pass the pin so attentive with the load order of the USBs
Prove that have modems (and win)
And if you send a log jam grep with Sebi to see that
Greetings
Morning (and hopefully more ordered as well)
