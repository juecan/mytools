Userspace programs will usually interact with DAHDI through device files under the /dev/dahdi directory (pedantically: character device files with major number 196) . Those device files can be generated statically or dynamically through the udev system.

/dev/dahdi/ctl (196:0) - a general device file for various information and control operations on the DAHDI channels.

/dev/dahdi/chan/N/M - A device file for channel M in span N

Both N and M are zero padded 3 digit numbers

Both N and M start at 001

M is chanpos - numbering relative to the current span.

/dev/dahdi/NNN (196:NNN) - for NNN in the range 1-249. A device file for DAHDI channel NNN. It can be used to read data from the channel and write data to the channel. It is not generated by default but may be generated as a symlink using udev rules.

/dev/dahdi/transcode (196:250) - Used to connect to a DAHDI transcoding device.

/dev/dahdi/timer (196:253) - Allows setting timers. Used anywhere?

/dev/dahdi/channel (196:254) - Can be used to open an arbitrary DAHDI channel. This is an alternative to /dev/dahdi/NNN that is not limited to 249 channels.

/dev/dahdi/pseudo (196:255) - A timing-only device. Every time you open it, a new DAHDI channel is created. That DAHDI channel is "pseudo" - DAHDI receives no data in it, and only sends garbage data with the same timing as the DAHDI timing master device.
