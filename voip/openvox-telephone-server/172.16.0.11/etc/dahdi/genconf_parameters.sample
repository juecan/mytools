# When generating extensions for chan_dahdi.conf or users.conf etc: the 
# extension number will be channel_number+base_exten . The default is:
#base_exten		4000
#
# Make FXS (analog phones) extensions answer immediately (sets
# 'immediate = yes' for them in chan_dahdi.conf). Don't enable this before 
# you're read documentation about this option.
#fxs_immediate		yes
#
# For FXS (analog phones) - use KS or LS? ks is the only method for
# Asterisk to provide disconnect supervision and thus it would normally
# be preferred and is the default.
#fxs_default_start	ls
#
# For FXO (analog lines) - use KS or LS? KS is the default and is
# normally the better choice as it allows detecting hang-ups on many
# lines.
#fxo_default_start	ls

# Set tone zone values. This is used for playing tones (busy, dial-tone
# and such). The default is 'us'. This sets the value for both loadzone
# and defaultzone in system.conf .
#lc_country		il

# The dialplan context into which to send trunks in chan_dahdi.conf or
# users.conf. The default value is:
#context_lines		from-pstn
#
# The dialplan context into which to send extensions in chan_dahdi.conf or
# users.conf. The default value is:
#context_phones		from-internal
#
# Two extra contexts for the input ports and output ports of an
# Astribank. Default values are:
#context_input		astbank-input
#context_output		astbank-output

# A group to put all analog phones in. By default 0, so you can dial to
# the 'first phone available' using Dahdi/g5 .
#group_phones		5
#
# A group in which to put all the channels belonging to some trunk.
# Thus you can dial through "some trunk" using Dahdi/G0/NUMBER
#group_lines		0

# Channels of digital trunk of span N are also added to group 10+N (that 
# is: 14 for channels of span 4).

# Do we want to use PtP ('bri') or PtMP ('bri_ptmp') for BRI? PtMP 
# allows connecting several CPE devices on the same network device 
# (several BRI phones on the same line, kind of like several analog 
# phones on the same analog line). However it is generally brings 
# unnecessary complexity for a pbx-pbx connection. It is still the 
# default as this is normally what you get for a BRI PSTN connection.
#bri_sig_style		bri
#
# If this option is set (that is: not remmed-out), BRI NT ports will 
# also be set as overlap. This is useful if you want to connect ISDN 
# phones.
#brint_overlap

# The echo canceler to use. If you have a hardware echo canceler, just 
# leave it be, as this one won't be used anyway.
#
# The default is mg2, but it may change in the future. E.g: a packager
# that bundles a better echo canceler may set it as the default, or
# dahdi_genconf will scan for the "best" echo canceler.
#
#echo_can		hpec
#echo_can		oslec
#echo_can		none  # to avoid echo canceler altogether

# bri_hardhdlc:
#   'yes'  - forces BRI cards to use 'hardhdlc' signalling.
#   'no'   - forces BRI cards to use 'dchan' (an alias for 'fcshdlc').
#            It is usefull only for dahdi with the bristuff patch.
#
# If it is left out or set to 'auto':
#   * Information supplied by the driver is used to decide:
#     - Currently implemented for Astribanks.
#     - Taken from /sys/bus/xpds/drivers/bri/dchan_hardhdlc.
#   * Without this info, falls back to 'hardhdlc'.
#bri_hardhdlc		auto

# For MFC/R2 Support: 'R2' will make E1 spans CAS and with the
# 'r2_idle_bits' bit in system.conf . It will also make dahdi_genconf default
# to generating the channels of this card in unicall.conf rather than in
# chan_dahdi.conf . The meaning of this may be extended somehow to support
# R2 through openr2/chan_dahdi later on.
#pri_connection_type	R2
#pri_connection_type	CAS
#
# Explicitly set the idle bits for E1 CAS (Sample value is the default):
#r2_idle_bits		1101
#
# Set T1 framing type to d4 instead of esf:
#tdm_framing		d4
#
# Use E&M on CAS (default is FXS/FXO). If set, E1 spans will be used as
# E&M-E1 and T1 will use the requested type:
#em_signalling em
#em_signalling em_w
#em_signalling featd
#em_signalling featdtmf
#em_signalling featdtmf_ta
#em_signalling featb
#em_signalling fgccama
#em_signalling fgccamamf
#
# pri_termtype contains a list of settings:
# Currently the only setting is for TE or NT (the default is TE). This
# sets two different but normally related configuration items:
# 
# A TE span will have *_cpe signalling in Asterisk and will also get
# timing from the remote party.
# 
# A NT span will have *_new signalling in Asterisk and will provide
# timing to the remote party.
#
# pri_termtype is a list if span specs and configuration (TE/NT) for
# them. The first spec that matches is used. The matching is of perl
# regular expressions, but with '*' and '?' have their meaning from
# basic regular expressions.
#pri_termtype
#	SPAN/2		NT
#	SPAN/4		NT
#
#pri_termtype
#	SPAN/*		NT
#
# Astribanks can be matched by span and also by their:
#    LABEL + XPD number:
#      this is burned into the Astribank and won't change
#      if it's connected via different USB port/hub
#    CONNECTOR + XPD number:
#      The USB path to which the Astribank is connected.
#      Replacing an Astribank and connecting to the same USB port/hub
#      would not change this property. However, any change in USB
#      wiring (e.g: adding another hub) may alter this.
#    NUM (XBUS number) + XPD number:
#      The XBUS number. This is not stable and may even change
#      between boots.
