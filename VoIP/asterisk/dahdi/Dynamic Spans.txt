Dynamic spans are spans that are not represented by real hardware. Currently there are two types of them:

tdmoe
TDM over Ethernet. A remote span is identified by an ethernet (MAC) address.

local
Generates a span that is actually a loopback to a different local span.

Modules that support the dynamic spans are typically loaded at the time the ioctl DAHDI_DYNAMIC_CREATE is called. This is typically called by dahdi_cfg when it has a line such as:

dynamic,somename,params
in /etc/dahdi/system.conf . In that case it will typically try to load (through modprobe) the modules dahdi_dynamic and dahdi_dynamic_¡¯somename'. It will then pass params to it.

Dynamic spans are known to be tricky and are some of the least-tested parts of DAHDI.
