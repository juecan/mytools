DAHDI provides telephony channels to the userspace applications. Those channels are channels are incorporated into logical units called spans.

With digital telephony adapters (e.g: E1 or T1), a span normally represents a single port. With analog telephony a span typically represents a PCI adapter or a similar logical unit.

Both channels and spans are identified by enumerating numbers (beginning with 1). The number of the channel is the lowest unused one when it is generated, and ditto for spans.

There are up to 128 spans and 1024 channels. This is a hard-wired limit (see dahdi/user.h . Several places throuout the code assume a channel number fits in a 16 bits number). Channel and span numbers start at 1.
