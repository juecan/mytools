(most modules)

Sets debug mode / debug level. With most modules debug can be either disabled (0, the default value) or enabled (any other value).

wctdm and wcte1xp print several extra debugging messages if the value of debug is more than 1.

Some modules have "debugging flags" bits - the value of debug is a bitmask and several messages are printed if some bits are set:

To get a list of parameters supported by a module, use

modinfo module_name
Or, for a module you have just built:

modinfo ./drivers/dahdi/module_name.ko
For the xpp modules this will also include the description and default value of the module. You can find a list of useful xpp module parameters in README.Astribank .

wctdm24xxp:

1: DEBUG_CARD

2: DEBUG_ECHOCAN

wct4xxp:

1: DEBUG_MAIN

2: DEBUG_DTMF

4: DEBUG_REGS

8: DEBUG_TSI

16: DEBUG_ECHOCAN

32: DEBUG_RBS

64: DEBUG_FRAMER

xpp: See also README.Astribank:

1: GENERAL - General debug comments.

2: PCM - PCM-related messages. Tend to flood logs.

4: LEDS - Anything related to the LEDs status control. The driver produces a lot of messages when the option is enabled.

8: SYNC - Synchronization related messages.

16: SIGNAL - DAHDI signalling related messages.

32: PROC - Messages related to the procfs interface.

64: REGS - Reading and writing to chip registers. Tends to flood logs.

128: DEVICES - Device instantiation, destruction and such.

256 - COMMANDS - Protocol commands. Tends to flood logs. 

The script xpp_debug in the source tree can help settting them at run time.
