#include iax_general_additional.conf
#include iax_general_custom.conf
#include iax_registrations_custom.conf
#include iax_registrations.conf

; These should all be expected to come after the [general] context
;
;iax_custom.conf is the proper place to start creating new contexts that you 
;might have a need for.  Dundi IAX trunks is one example of when this file is needed.

#include iax_custom.conf
#include iax_additional.conf
;
;iax_custom_post.conf will allow you to modify FreePBX generated IAX setups so
;that you can add additional parameters to a auto-generated setup.
;if you have a auto-generated context of [foobar] and need to add a parameter 
;to it then create this line [foobar](+) and place your additions on the next line
