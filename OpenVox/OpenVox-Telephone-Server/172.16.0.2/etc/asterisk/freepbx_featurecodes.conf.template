; Feature Code Default Override Configuration File
;
; freepbx_featurecodes.conf
;
; This file is used to override the default featurecode values provided
; by each FreePBX module. It will not change modified values. This can
; be used to localize featurecodes different from those chosen by each
; module and hardcoded into the system.
;
; The format is standard ini file format where each section is a raw
; modulename and each entry under a section is the featurecode.
;
; You can typically see the feature codes present in a module by looking
; at their install.php script or otherwise look at the featurecodes sql
; table.
;
; As an example, the module donotdisturb, you will see some entries in
; the install.php script that look like:
;
; $fcc = new featurecode('donotdisturb', 'dnd_on');
; $fcc = new featurecode('donotdisturb', 'dnd_off');
; $fcc = new featurecode('donotdisturb', 'dnd_toggle');
;
; To override those featurecodes to something *21, *22 and *23, you would 
; create standard ini entries such as:
;
; [donnotdisturb]
; dnd_on = *21
; dnd_off = *22
; dnd_toggle = *23
;
; FreePBX will then begin using those entries. You will seem them displayed
; on the Featurecode Admin page and next time a configuration is generated
; they should be updated in the featurecode sql table.
;
; This ini file must remain in place since modules regularly reset such
; codes when new versions are uploaded but the presence of this file and
; its settings will override any such changes
;
